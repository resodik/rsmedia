      <p>My name is <strong>Renata Sobieniak</strong> and I’m a graduate of Design studies with a specialization in Game Development. I’ve always been passionate about video games — not only as a player, but as someone deeply fascinated by the technical and artistic process of creating game worlds. </p>

 <p>My growing interest led me to treat my thesis as an opportunity: an excuse to dive even deeper into the development pipeline while also completing my degree and opening new paths for future growth.

  <h2> Building My Own Game – From Thesis to Full Production</h2>
 <p>
  During my studies, I created a short, playable section of a game world — 
  you can see some of it in my 
  <a href="index.html" class="inline-btn">portfolio</a>. 
  After graduating, I decided to keep going.
</p>

 <p>I successfully applied for a startup grant, which allowed me to invest in professional tools such as a motion capture suit, a resin and filament 3D printer, a new graphic tablet, and upgraded hardware.</p>

<a class="btn scroll-to-figures" title="Zjedź do sekcji Gear" role="button" tabindex="0">My Gear</a>

 <p> I'm constantly learning and exploring new workflows and technologies that improve the quality and efficiency of my work — something I deeply care about.</p>

 <p>Currently, I’m developing my own game in Unreal Engine 5, which allows me to grow across every aspect of game creation. I'm building custom assets in Blender and implementing gameplay mechanics — creating everything from scratch to maintain full creative control. Textures and animations are next on my list, but for now, I’m following a structured, hands-on development process that lets me prototype, test, and iterate in real time.</p>
